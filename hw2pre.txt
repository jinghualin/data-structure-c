hw2p Airline Reservation using Linked List Part 1
(hw2.pre Linked List (Reservation))

hw2p-xx.c should be the right name of your homework.

This program makes reservation only for one class(economy)by using one linked list. So operations are inserting a customer, deleting a customer, modifying a customer's information, and printing the list of customers. 

Searching should be done by any fields. It should show proper index number.
So canceling or modifying should use this index number.

Top menu should show as following:

Welcome to my simple airline reservation !!!!

Make a [R]eservation
[C]ancel a reservation
[M]odify a customer's information
[L]ist reservations
[S]earch reservations
